# Poker-Hands-Project
A Python program that takes poker hands and interprets them as their best hands, allowing them to be compared to other poker hands as better/worse/equals.

This was a project I did in high school. I would post other projects but they unfortunately are gone now that I cannot access them through my high school email.
